# Accessing Android device using ssh !

I always wonder is there a way to access our phone though ssh because its always a burden for me to use termux in my android because of its uncompatibiliy ui&ux . So i tried googling and found a wonderful app to do this [sshdroid](https://apkpure.com/sshdroid/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid)

But you need to connect your device and pc you are using to the wifi â€¦.it only work in LAN(local area network)

First connect to the wifi from your device Im using poco f1

open sshdriod and click start.
