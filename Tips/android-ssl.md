After a long struggle and help of many resources………… i learned how to do ssl pinning on android…! This can help to bypass ssl pinning of 70% of apps

It helped me to bypass ssl pinning of so many apps like gmail,youtube, app,twitter,zomato. etc..

But also it didnt helped me in instagram,snapchat,facebook

I dont know why but i didnt see any traffic of whatsapp and telegram because they dont communicate in http and https protocol and also from web sockets also.

In this device The things i used were

- A rooted mobile with magisk manger (you can take help of xda to root your mobile . youtube is much helpful though)
- [xposed](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer) also must be installed and must be active.

The device I’m using is poco f1 and it’s running android pie miui version.

- Install these modules in xposed installer

   - ssl unpinning apk
   -  trust me already module
   - root cloak (advanced version)
   - bankcontact Root bypasser
