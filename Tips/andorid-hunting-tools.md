4) apk analyzer (This is an android apk which is helpful for categorizing differenet parts of manifest file. runtime analying.)

5) Mobsf (This is helpful for automating android vulnerability scanning docker also availble .)\

6) jadx (available cross platform helpful for decompiling the apk as java files)

7) Jd-gui (An editor for java files)

8)Android application analyzer (This was a new tool from not so secure team.Really a great tool for analyzer files of a particular apk inside the android os)
